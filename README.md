# 🛡️ Process Behavior Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains the machine learning and data analysis layer of a system that monitors and flags suspicious process behavior. While the cybersecurity module handles data collection (e.g., system hooks, networking activity), this repo focuses on analyzing that data using ML to detect threats.

## 🎯 Goals

- Monitor resource usage patterns (CPU, memory, I/O, network)
- Detect anomalous behavior using ML
- Assign threat scores to help identify malicious processes
